# Artificial Intelligence
This is my first two assignments for MYYY602 Artificial Intelligence course. The first exercise is to solve the N-puzzle problem (8-puzzle in our case), by using the UCS and A* algorithm. The second assignment is to build a game (similar to tic tac toe) with 2 final states: "CSE" and "ESC" in a 3x3 board.
